## Description

`chirpR` is a work in progress. Originally being built for internal use
only, I decided that maybe there are others that would benifit from this
tool.

`chirpR` is an R package that simplifies the process of analyzing and
interpreting bird acoustic monitoring data. It provides a user-friendly
wrapper for
[BirdNet-Analyzer](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer) and
[ecoVAD](https://github.com/NINAnor/ecoVAD), allowing users to easily
install and run BirdNet and ecoVAD directly from R. Additionally,
`chirpR` includes a collection of functions for analyzing and
visualizing BirdNet output. Developed with a semi-automated analysis
pipeline in mind, `chirpR` streamlines the analysis process.

## About

Developed by ü¶úAndrew Fairbairn

Current lab: [Chair for Terrestrial
Ecology](https://www3.ls.tum.de/en/toek/home/), Technical University of
Munich

[Homepage](https://afairbairn.com/)

## Installation

You can install chirpR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AFairbairn/chirpR")
```

`chirpR` requires Python 3.8 \<= 3.10 To install a supported version of
Python, head over to <https://www.python.org/>, hover over downloads,
select your operating system and then scroll down to the installer for a
supported version of python. Download and follow the installation
instructions. Be sure at add Python to your systems PATH. This is
usually an option during installation, but if not do a search for adding
Python to PATH of your particular operating system.

## BirdNet Example

Installing and running BirdNet:

``` r
library(chirpR)

## Install BirdNet
birdNet.install()
#> Python Python 3.11.2 is installed.
#> Python Python 3.10.10 is installed.
#> Using Python version: Python 3.10.10
#> Getting BirdNet...
#> Download completed with exit code: 0
#> Creating virtual environment...
#> Done! BirdNET is ready to use.

## Run BirdNet using default settings
## i is the input files path, as in BirdNet-Analyze
results <- birdNet.analyze(i="E:/acoustic recordings", o="E:/bnResults")
head(results[,c(4:6)])
#>       scientific_name        common_name confidence
#> 1:             Engine             Engine     0.1579
#> 2:      Turdus merula Eurasian Blackbird     0.1027
#> 3: Scolopax rusticola  Eurasian Woodcock     0.1033
#> 4:      Turdus merula Eurasian Blackbird     0.3508
#> 5:      Turdus merula Eurasian Blackbird     0.5635
#> 6:  Turdus viscivorus      Mistle Thrush     0.2606
```

:warning: **If you are using Linux or RStudio Server** There is an issue
where birdNet.analyze() may not find the location of the birdNET
installation. If birdNet.install() runs correctly and you run into this
issue, please add
path=‚Äú{path.to.R.packages}/chirpR/birdNet/BirdNET-Analyzer-main‚Äù to
birdNet.analyze().

## ecoVAD Example

Setup ecoVAD:

``` r
library(chirpR)

## Setup ecoVad
#ecoVAD.setup()
```

### Training ecoVAD models

The developers of [ecoVAD](https://github.com/NINAnor/ecoVAD) recommend
training using the OpenSLR LibriSpeech English language library. As a
service for our users, I thought that I would provide a list to several
speech libraries for different languages below. This is not an
exhaustive list and I would appreciate submission of additional
resources. Just contact me!

- English
  - [LibriSpeech ASR corpus](https://www.openslr.org/12/)
- German
  - [LibriVoxDeEn](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/librivoxdeen/)
  - [LibriVox MP3
    bundle](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/mmk/verschiedenes/german-speech-corpus-aligned-with-ctc-segmentation/)
