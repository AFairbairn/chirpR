## Description

`chirpR` is a work in progress. Originally being built for internal use
only, I decided that maybe there are others that would benefit from this
tool.

`chirpR` is an R package that simplifies the process of preparing,
analyzing and interpreting
[BirdNET](https://github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Analyzer) results.
