## Author

Andrew Fairbairn https://afairbairn.com/

bnanalysis is to provides a collection of functions for installing, running BirdNet and analyzing BirdNet results. These functions can be used to create a semi-automated analysis pipeline.

## Installation

You can install bnanalysis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AFairbairn/bnanalysis")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to install and use BirdNet:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(bnanalysis)

setwd("D:/myProject")

## Install BirdNet
getBN()

## Run BirdNet using default settings
## i is the input files path, as in BirdNet-Analyze
results <- analyze(i="D:/acoustic recordings")
head(results)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


* Features to-do list:
  + Support for operating systems other than Windows.
  + Function to create output tables for, for example, odd detections in Kaleidoscope or other.
  + Function for calculating species frequency - i.e. "minute calls" VAR "Vocal Activity Rate"
  + Visualization functions for the bird community - see Sethi Norway paper for e.g.
