## Description

`bnanalysis` is an R package that simplifies the process of analyzing and interpreting BirdNet data. It provides a user-friendly wrapper for [BirdNet-Analyzer](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer), allowing users to easily install and run BirdNet directly from R. Additionally, `bnanalysis` includes a collection of functions for analyzing and visualizing BirdNet output. Developed with a semi-automated analysis pipeline in mind, `bnanalysis` streamlines the BirdNet analysis process.

* Features to-do list:
  + Support for operating systems other than Windows.
  + Function to create output tables for, for example, odd detections in Kaleidoscope or other.
  + Function for calculating VAR "Vocal Activity Rate"
  + Visualization functions for the bird community
